// API key scopes — pure, unit-testable, no I/O.
//
// Authorization for the public API is *scopes-only*: a key's
// capabilities are defined entirely by the scopes granted to it at
// creation, independent of the role of the user who minted it. (We
// still gate *key creation* at admin+, so only trusted members can
// hand out capabilities — see the management routes.)
//
// A scope is `<resource>:<action>`. Endpoints declare the single
// scope they require; `requireApiKey(request, scope)` enforces it.
// Adding a capability = one entry here + the endpoint that checks
// it. No migration needed (the DB stores scopes as a free `text[]`).
